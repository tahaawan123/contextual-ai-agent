# ðŸ§  Context-Aware AI Agent

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful **context-aware AI agent** built using the Agentic AI framework.

The core idea is to enable an agent that can understand and use **structured context data** (in this case, user information like name, age, and UID) to provide accurate, relevant responses â€” instead of guessing or hallucinating.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Context?

Most language models generate responses based only on the input prompt. But when we need them to work with **specific structured data**, we need to pass context.

This project uses:
- A `User_Info` context object to hold data
- A `fetch_user_data` tool function to access it
- An agent with clear instructions to **use the tool only when needed**, based on the userâ€™s query
- Gemini 2.0 Flash as the LLM backend

## ðŸ§  How It Works

When the user asks something like:

> "What is the user's age and name?"

The agent:
- Recognizes the request
- Uses the registered tool `fetch_user_data`
- Fetches data from the context
- Responds with:  
  `User Name: Taha, Age: 24, UID: 335839`

This design ensures:
âœ… Accuracy  
âœ… Contextual awareness  
âœ… Separation of logic, tools, and instructions
